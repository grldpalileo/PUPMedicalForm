After changing my zoom to 80% the layout is already fixed. But it still depends on the device that you are using. 

11. Then you can already fill up the form and after answering all the questions you may click submit.

12. Then if you want to see if the data you inputted is stored in the database, you may go to localhost/phpmyadmin

13. Look for the medical_db schema then click it twice. You will see two tables there and you just need to reload the site to see if the data has been stored successfully.
